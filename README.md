# e-agrodoc

E-AgroDoc is an app which uses state of the art deep learning techniques to help farmers optimize farming techniques. E-AgroDoc has multiple features like Disease Detection, Crop Recommendations, Fertilizer suggestions.

### Disease Detection
 It is centered around visual information and deep learning techniques, which allows farmers to effectively recognize plant diseases at early stages and suggest suitable remedies.Our models are trained on an open source dataset to have state of the art performance. Based on the images uploaded by the farmer, most of the crop diseases are detected.

### Crop Recommendation
Suitable crops are recommended based on the soil data collected from the farmers, the climate information and the real time news extracted by our AI models to make an appropriate recommendation of the crop that results in more profits.

### Fertilizer Suggestions
According to the crop selected in the app and with respect to the soil the fertilizer suggestions are given. We will develop a dataset in the process of developing an app where we have fertilizer recommendations for specific crop types.


> After completing Stage 1 of development of the app, the app will be open sourced which gives a lot of scope to the app for making the existing features better and implementing new and better features.
